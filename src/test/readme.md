This directory is source for a test harness.
Test harness exercised the library and logs using RTT.

Not part of the library.
The library can be built with logging using RTT enabled,
but the app calling the library must build in the segger_RTT code.

When I wrote this readme, this is stale and the build is broken.
I have moved on from the test harness.
Instead I use another app/project to test the library.

Depends on src/sdk_config.h and seggerConfig.h
